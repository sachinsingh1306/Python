# The game() function in a program lets a user play a game and returns the score as an integer. You need to read a file 'Hi-score.txt' which is either blank or contains the previous Hi-score. You need to write a program to update the Hi-score whenever the game() function breaks the Hi-score.

import random

def game():
    print("You are playing a game")
    score = random.randint(1, 62)

    with open("Hi-score.txt", "r") as f:
        content = f.read().strip()
        if content.isdigit():
            highscore = int(content)
        else:
            highscore = 0

    print(f"Your Score : {score}")

    if score > highscore:
        with open("Hi-score.txt", "w") as f:
            f.write(str(score))
